Careto is a pet project to play with express, the web development framework for nodejs.

Careto is a Spanish slang word that means 'Face'. This project intends to create a contacts database, so careto seemed like an apropriate name!

Dependencies: jade, sass, expresso, mongoose.
I also use nodemon (https://github.com/remy/nodemon/) to restart the server automtically

Versions: node v0.5.0-pre ||| express 2.3.0 ||| mongoose 1.3.0

Have added a test file that stores an object in a MongoDB running locally, so that is a dependency now!



TODO
____
- Look at expresso for testing and maybe replace with Jasmine if possible
- CRUD for careto objects (now that mongoose is working should be easier!)
