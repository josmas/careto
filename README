Careto is a pet project to play with express, the web development framework for nodejs.

Careto is a Spanish slang word that means 'Face'. This project intends to create a contacts database, so careto seemed like an apropriate name!

Dependencies: jade, sass, expresso.

Versions: node v0.5.0-pre ||| express 2.3.0
